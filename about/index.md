Hello, my name is Brittany Boribong. I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Research Fellow at Harvard Medical School where I work under [Lael Yonker, MD](https://www.massgeneral.org/children/doctors/19392/lael-yonker). I received my B.S. from the [University of Scranton](http://www.scranton.edu/) in [Biomathematics](http://admissions.scranton.edu/academic-programs/majors-minors/programs/biomathematics.shtml) in 2015 and my PhD in [Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (GBCB)](https://gbcb.graduateschool.vt.edu/) in 2020, where I was also a pre-doctoral scholar in the [Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD)](http://imsd.apsc.vt.edu/) program at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu/). My research interests lie in mathematical modeling of dynamic biological processes, particularly within innate immunity. During my PhD, I worked under [Caroline Jones, PhD](https://jones.biol.vt.edu/) and [Liwu Li, PhD](http://www.faculty.biol.vt.edu/li/) from the Department of Biological Sciences. My research involves quantifying neutrophil migration during sepsis using microfluidic devices and deterministic ODE modeling. To learn more about my current research, please visit my [research page](https://boribong.github.io/research/). In addition to research, I am very passionate about [service and outreach](https://boribong.github.io/service/).
