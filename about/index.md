Hello! My name is Brittany Boribong. I am currently a Senior Scientist at [DropGenie](https://www.drop-genie.com/). I was previously a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, working under [Lael Yonker, MD](https://www.massgeneral.org/children/doctors/19392/lael-yonker). My postdoc work research involved studying immune responses to pediatric COVID-19, Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), and Long COVID, as well as children's response to COVID mRNA vaccines. I received my Ph.D. in [Genetics, Bioinformatics, and Computational Biology (GBCB)](https://gbcb.graduateschool.vt.edu/) in 2020, where I was also a pre-doctoral scholar in the [Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD)](http://imsd.apsc.vt.edu/) program at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu/). My Ph.D. research involved quantifying neutrophil migration during sepsis using microfluidic devices and deterministic ODE modeling. I received my B.S. from the [University of Scranton](http://www.scranton.edu/) in [Biomathematics](http://admissions.scranton.edu/academic-programs/majors-minors/programs/biomathematics.shtml) in 2015. Please visit my [research page](https://boribong.github.io/research/) to learn more about my research. <!-- In addition to research, I am very passionate about [service and outreach](https://boribong.github.io/service/). --> <br><br>
