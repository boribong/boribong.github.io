<center><img src="https://www.dropbox.com/s/bcdgpibadngrd92/Scranton-Logo.png?raw=1" width="187" height="217"></center>

**Location:** Scranton, Pennsylvania

**Country:** United States of America


**University Information:** University of Scranton is a small Jesuit, private, research institution focused on the liberal arts. While offering several post-graduate degrees, the University of Scranton's focus is mainly on undergraduate education. 

Their [mission statement](http://www.scranton.edu/about/jesuit-tradition/index.shtml) is as followed:

>JESUIT TRADITION
>
>Spirituality is at the core of our mission as a Catholic, Jesuit institution of higher learning. The chief characteristics embedded in the Ignatian vision include: the concept of the Magis, or a restless pursuit of excellence grounded in gratitude; Cura Personalis, individual attention to students and respect for the uniqueness of each member of the University community; seeking God in all things; liberal education; service of faith and the promotion of justice; and contemplation in action.
>
>OUR MISSION
>
>The University of Scranton is a Catholic and Jesuit university animated by the spiritual vision and the tradition of excellence characteristic of the Society of Jesus and those who share its way of proceeding.  The University is a community dedicated to the freedom of inquiry and personal development fundamental to the growth in wisdom and integrity of all who share its life.
>
>OUR VISION
>
>The University of Scranton will be boldly driven by a shared commitment to excellence.  We will provide a superior, transformational learning experience, preparing students who, in the words of Jesuit founder St. Ignatius Loyola, will "set the world on fire."


The university's mission statement is heavily rooted in Jesuit and Catholic teachings. Jesuits are known for being teachers, thus it is no surprise that this statement places a large emphasis on achieving a superior learning experience through growth in wisdom and spirituality. However, their statement is rather vague, mentioning that their education is "transformative" but not describing how and in what way this will help prepare their students. In this mission statement, the university is committing itself to following the ways of the Society of Jesus, believing this will allow the university to prosper.

This mission statement emphasizes the advancement of research/knowledge as an overarching goal of the university, as well as the qualities and methods they believe to be instrumental. The statement also acknowledges the importance of a diverse student population to the success of the university and its commitment in ensuring this is achieved. The university also greatly values human health and commits itself to bettering the human condition.

Both universities state service as a value of their institution. University of Scranton specifies the importance of service of faith and Virginia Commonwealth University values service to benefit the public, both home and abroad. 


On the advancement of knowledge, the University of Scranton believes that following the way of God will lead their students to great wisdom whereas Virginia Commonwealth University believes that community and environment, through collaborations and diverse populations, are necessities for growth in knowledge. Although both universities are classified as research institutions, only Virginia Commonwealth University details its definition of research. Virginia Commonwealth University also mentions specifically its commitment to research benefiting human health and condition, whereas the University of Scranton does not mention any specific type of research its institution focuses on.


Virginia Commonwealth University emphasizes environment and community as needed for success, where the University of Scranton does not place too large of an importance on this point. Both universities mention state that each member of their community is unique and to be respected. However, Virginia Commonwealth University goes further to state that diversity is needed to to ensure a successful university, which University of Scranton fails to mention. Interestingly, this can be seen in the lack of a [diverse student population](http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg06_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=47) in the University of Scranton in comparison to the [student population](http://www.collegedata.com/cs/data/college/college_pg06_tmpl.jhtml?schoolId=1565) at Virginia Commonwealth University. 


Both mission statements define the goals set out for their respective universities, which happen to have several goals in common with one another. Virginia Commonwealth University goes into more detail as to how they would like to achieve their goals whereas the University of Scranton prefers to refer back to religious ideologies. Both statements also clearly show the difference between the two universities. University of Scranton, being a religiously-affiliated institution, places a large emphasis on the teachings of the Society of Jesus and how they are ingrained into the core of the university. Virgnia Commonwealth University, on the other hand, is a R1 research institution, and thus its mission statement on the importance of research and how to pursue and advance current knowledge.
